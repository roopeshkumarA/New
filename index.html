<p>Money Heist is one of the most-watched Spanish series by far on Netflix. It has a sophisticated storyline; it has drama, action and of course, love.</p>

<!--The <ins> tag defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text.----> <!---The <del> tag defines text that has been deleted from a document.--->A group of criminals with a mastermind known as the ‘Professor’ (from an external location) hijacks the<ins>Royal Mint of Spain</ins> <del>(Bank) </del>in Madrid.
<P>The trick is that they are not robbing anyone’s money; they are only using the bank’s equipment to print their own notes and escape.</P>
<P> The hostages were resistant; they had their own drama and top of it all, the police won’t give them a breathing space.</p>
